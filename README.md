# excel2pandas

Taking a look at Wayne L. Winston's book "Microsoft Excel 2016, Data Analysis and Business Modeling" I found an excercise consisting in finding the best combination between costs and prices to obtain the maximum profit for a coffee business. The result in the Excel spreadsheet looked as shown in the Screenshot image of the repo. I tried to solve the same problem using python's pandas library.
